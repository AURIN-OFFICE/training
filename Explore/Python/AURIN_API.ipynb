    "The AURIN Application Programming Interface (API), is an interface that allows you to use a programming language to interact with an application, and perform tasks such as getting data, updating data, or deleting data. The AURIN API is such an interface that allows users to access data and metadata available from the AURIN Data Catalogue. You can send a request to the API using Python scripts and get a response to download specific datasets. The API is based on [Open Geospatial Consortium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Geospatial_Consortium \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Geospatial_Consortium\") Web Feature Service (WFS) Interface Standards.\n",

    "### g. Filter Data by Bounding Box\n",
    "\n",
    "The AURIN API supports spatial queries that permit filtering your data in a particular spatial area. For example, you can filter the data by bounding box (BBOX). By adding the BBOX, instead of downloading entire datasets, which can be very large and irrelevant to your project, you can download data according to your area of interest. Here we show an example to use the Melbourne CBD as the area of interest. The BBOX is a function from [shapely.geometry](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html \"https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html\").\n",
    "\n",
    "The BBOX parameter allows you to search for features that are contained (or partially contained) inside a box of user-defined coordinates. The format of the BBOX parameter is `bbox=a1,b1,a2,b2,[crs]` where `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, and `b2` represent the coordinate values, `crs` refers to the [coordinate reference system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_reference_system \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_reference_system\"). If you’d like to know more about Australian geospatial reference system, please click [here](https://www.icsm.gov.au/datum/gda-frequently-asked-questions \"https://www.icsm.gov.au/datum/gda-frequently-asked-questions\"). The `shapely.geometry.box()` function makes a rectangular polygon from the provided BBOX parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend using [BBox finder](http://bboxfinder.com/#-37.823111,144.931258,-37.805108,144.976358 \"http://bboxfinder.com/#-37.823111,144.931258,-37.805108,144.976358\") to create your BBOX using a base map. Click the rectangle icon and draw a rectangle using your mouse to cover the Melbourne CBD area or any other areas you are interested in.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can see the selected rectangle is covered in pink. You may check if it is the right area you’d like to collect data from. Copy the BBOX coordinates from the highlighted area, and replace the coordinates after the code `min_x,min_y,max_x,max_y =`.\n",
